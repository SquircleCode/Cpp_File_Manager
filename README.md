# Future Plans
Trying to make a command line IDE. Please refer the Projects Section. Any help will be really appreciated


# Cpp File Manager

A simple collection of scripts that saves time and does the boring stuff while doing lab assignments.
Please use it and give your feedback
Feel Free to make any changes to any part of the program.

# Highlights
1. Creates and organises C++ programs according to the lab and question number.
2. Creates each file with some basic code (libraries, main method). Can be customised according to the users need
3. Compiles and runs the program
4. Connects to GitHub and creates a clone of your repository.
5. Transfers and Uploads files to GitHub.

# How To Install
1. Download all the files and move them to the Home Directory
2. Run install_cpp_file_manager.sh using
3. $ bash ~/install_cpp_file_manager.sh
4. Read and follow the instructions which are prompted
5. Copy your GitHub repository link and paste it when prompted
6. Enter the repository name when prompted
7. All done. Run the scripts from the home directory
Additionally : you can make these scripts into commands. Refer : https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/set-command-aliases-linuxubuntudebian/

# How to Use
The usage is pretty simple. Just run the scripts
Please run the scripts using ' $ bash ' instead of ' $ sh 'from the home directory. It does not work otherwise as sh doesn't have complete permisions

The Scripts which are meant to be used are :
1. openFile.sh to open existing files or create new ones (Checks and does it automatically)
2. runFile.sh to compile and run the file
3. transferFiles.sh to transfer files to the local GitHub Clone ( transfers both individual files and entire folders based on the users choice)
4. uploadFile.sh to upload all the files present in the Local GitHub Repository to GitHub.
5. fileMaker.cpp contains the default code that every new file has. Modify it according to your needs.
6. The remaining ones just do some background work.
